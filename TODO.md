# Track

* Current multiple inheritance pattern not working with static_cast (try reinterpret_cast)
* if it doesnt' work, why not having two vectors, each containing specific track with indexes, and methods to get_at (index).
* Removing track crashes (push a single element (track and hspacer) in the htile_composite, and the track in vector)
